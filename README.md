# Project for a Networks class
# Limited Functionality, sorting received packets and sending a sorted file of packet data back to the initial sender is not implemented as of 1/30/2024
# The goal was to randomly send packets to a receiver. The receiver would then sort the packet data using headers and put this data into a single txt file.  This sorted txt file would then be sent back to the sender.
# To run the program, the client is first run and then the server is run.  They were tested being run in separate instances of the command terminal.
